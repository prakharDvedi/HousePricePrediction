**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
**Introduction**
This model uses Linear regression model using gradient descent algorithm model by minimizing squared error cost function. and plotting the points and error by matplotlib. Given the area of the house as input and price as output.

**Getting Started**

To run the project locally:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
Install the necessary packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
Run the cells to explore the data, visualize relationships, and build the model.
Results and Conclusion
The linear regression model provides a basic understanding of how different features influence house prices. This project serves as a foundational example for predictive modeling, and further improvements could be made by using more advanced techniques or additional data.
