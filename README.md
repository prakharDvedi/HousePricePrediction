**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
**Introduction**
This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant variables. Using Linear Regression, a simple yet powerful statistical method, we aim to uncover the relationship between these features and house prices. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment and utilizes matplotlib for data visualization.

**Project Objectives**
Data Analysis: Explore and understand the dataset to identify key features that influence house prices.
Data Visualization: Use matplotlib to visualize relationships between variables and identify trends and patterns.
Model Development: Develop a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on selected features.
Model Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to ensure its accuracy.

**Technologies Used**
Python: The core programming language used for building the model.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment for developing and testing the code.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For building the linear regression model.
matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains information on various houses, including:
Square footage
Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
Location and proximity to key amenities
Year built, and other relevant features
The dataset is sourced from [Dataset Source], and it is cleaned and preprocessed before applying the linear regression model.

**Getting Started**

To run the project locally:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
Install the necessary packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
Run the cells to explore the data, visualize relationships, and build the model.
Results and Conclusion
The linear regression model provides a basic understanding of how different features influence house prices. This project serves as a foundational example for predictive modeling, and further improvements could be made by using more advanced techniques or additional data.
